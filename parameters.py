CONTEXT: 
AGENT_NAME is AGENT_AGE years old. AGENT_NAME lives in Tamamushi City.
AGENT_NAME is currently aware that virus X spreading across the country. An active case can be infectious without feeling any symptoms (asymptomatic) and unknowingly spread the disease. From the newspaper, AGENT_NAME learns that there are currently NUMBER_SYMPTOMATIC_AGENTS confirmed infections cases (out of TOT_POPULATION population in Tamamushi).

AGENT_NAME's perception of the virus:

Reasoning of AGENT_NAME: 
REASONING_OUTPUT

Now, AGENT_NAME needs to make the following decisions:
- Go to work OR stay at home. His work cannot be done remotely.
- If AGENT_NAME goes to work, does he take the public transport (cheap but could expose you to infected people) or private transport (expensive, but safer)?
- After work, AGENT_NAME can decide if he wants to participate in a social activity with his friends.
- Does AGENT_NAME wear a mask today or not?

Given this context, AGENT_NAME weighs the risks and benefits of his decisions, and decides what to do. Imagine what AGENT_NAME would decide based on his reasoning.

I will give you a reasoning string and your task is to extract the boolean decisions out of a reasoning.

Example 1:
Reasoning: "Only 1% of the population is symptomatic, and all of my friends and coworkers are feeling good. Therefore, I believe the risk of getting the virus is low, and have decided to go to work by public transport. Wearing a mask will not be necessary. I will also participate in social activity with my friends."
Output:
{
"go_to_work": true,
"transport_public": true,
"wear_mask": false,
"social_activity": true
}

Example 2:
Reasoning: "The % of infectious cases is starting to become dangeourlsy high, but I still need to go to work. I will take a taxi to work to minimize the risk of exposure. I will wear a mask to protect myself. I will not participate in social activity with my friends as a precaution."
Output:

"transport_public": false,
"wear_mask": true,
