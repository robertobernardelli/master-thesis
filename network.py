                        - If {self.name} goes to work, does he take the public transport (cheap but could expose you to infected people) or taxi (expensive, but safer)?
                        - After work, {self.name} can decide if he wants to participate in a social activity with his friends.
                        - Does {self.name} wear a mask today or not?
